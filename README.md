# OS-Updater
First Repository

Update Linux Operating Systems from Kodi interface.
This addon allows the user to update Linux Operating Systems from the Kodi interface.
Currently supported OS's are:
  * Debian based systems   
  * Arch based systems
  * RedHat based systems.
Specifically the Apt, Pacman, Yaourt, and Dnf based commands.

#**WARNING!**
If you are using a remote app to control Kodi (Kore, Yatse, etc) you will be sending your password to Kodi in clear text!
Make sure the network you are using this app on is secure!
I am unaware of anyway I can fix this.  But I will continue to look into it.
